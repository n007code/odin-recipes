    <h2>Best lemonade recipe</h2>
    <p>In the 1800's this is how people made lemonade—you can do it too! It's not that difficult, and tastes wonderful!</p>

    <p>lemons are packed with vitamin C, phytochemicals such as hesperidin and diosmin, and also fiber, all of which aid in keeping the heart and circulatory system healthy.</p>


    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>5 lemons</li>
        <li>1 ¼ quarts water</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the rinds from the 5 lemons and cut them into 1/2 inch slices. Set the lemons aside.</li>
        <li>Place the rinds in a bowl and sprinkle the sugar over them. Let this stand for about one hour, so that the sugar begins to soak up the oils from the lemons.</li>
        <li>Bring water to a boil in a covered saucepan and then pour the hot water over the sugared lemon rinds. Allow this mixture to cool for 20 minutes and then remove the rinds.</li>
        <li>Squeeze the lemons into another bowl. Pour the juice through a strainer into the sugar mixture. Stir well, pour into pitcher and pop it in the fridge! Serve with ice cubes.</li>
    </ol>
